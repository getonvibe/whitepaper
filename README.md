# GetOnVibe Whitepaper

## Abstract
The purpose of this white/litepaper is to introduce the Get On Vibe Network. GetOnVibe is social network that aims to eliminate profiteering by big tech based on customer data, preferences and thoughts. Content creators, whether big or small need to get rewarded and recognized 

## Introduction 
*Start with an overview of the whitepaper, the purpose of the token, and the problem it aims to solve.*

## What is Solana? 
Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that offers a unique combination of technologies to address the scalability and performance issues of existing blockchain technologies. It was founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, who previously worked on distributed systems at Qualcomm and Dropbox. Solana aims to provide a faster, cheaper, and more secure way to build decentralized applications (dApps) and scale blockchain infrastructure.

One of the key features of Solana is its ability to support a high volume of transactions per second. Solana's specialized architecture enables parallel processing, which allows it to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). This is significantly higher than the TPS of other popular blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, which currently supports around 15 TPS. This high TPS rate makes Solana an ideal platform for applications that require fast and high-volume transactions.

Another important feature of Solana is its low transaction fees. Unlike other blockchain platforms that have high transaction fees, Solana's fees are typically less than $0.01 per transaction. This is because Solana's architecture is designed to minimize the cost of validating transactions, making it more cost-effective for users to interact with the platform.

Solana also supports special tokens, which are tokens that have specific properties or functions. Special tokens can be used for a variety of purposes, including governance, staking, and utility. For example, Solana supports tokens that are used to vote on protocol changes or tokens that provide access to specific dApps.

Additionally, Solana's architecture enables it to support smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that can be used to automate various business processes. Smart contracts can be used to create decentralized applications that run on the Solana blockchain, which can be used for a wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social networking.

Solana's development team has been continuously improving the platform since its launch, releasing regular updates and introducing new features. As of 2023, Solana is one of the fastest-growing blockchain platforms in the market, with a rapidly expanding ecosystem of dApps, exchanges, and other blockchain projects.

These features, especially high TPS rates, low transaction fees, support for special tokens, and smart contracts make the **Solana** chain the best choice for **Get On Vibe**. There is wide spread Dex support, a lot of active development which shows that Solana is here to stay.
