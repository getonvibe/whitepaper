## Introduction 
*Start with an overview of the whitepaper, the purpose of the token, and the problem it aims to solve.*

## What is Solana? 
Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform that offers a unique combination of technologies to address the scalability and performance issues of existing blockchain technologies. It was founded in 2017 by Anatoly Yakovenko, who previously worked on distributed systems at Qualcomm and Dropbox. Solana aims to provide a faster, cheaper, and more secure way to build decentralized applications (dApps) and scale blockchain infrastructure.

One of the key features of Solana is its ability to support a high volume of transactions per second. Solana's specialized architecture enables parallel processing, which allows it to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). This is significantly higher than the TPS of other popular blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, which currently supports around 15 TPS. This high TPS rate makes Solana an ideal platform for applications that require fast and high-volume transactions.

Another important feature of Solana is its low transaction fees. Unlike other blockchain platforms that have high transaction fees, Solana's fees are typically less than $0.01 per transaction. This is because Solana's architecture is designed to minimize the cost of validating transactions, making it more cost-effective for users to interact with the platform.

Solana also supports special tokens, which are tokens that have specific properties or functions. Special tokens can be used for a variety of purposes, including governance, staking, and utility. For example, Solana supports tokens that are used to vote on protocol changes or tokens that provide access to specific dApps.

Additionally, Solana's architecture enables it to support smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts that can be used to automate various business processes. Smart contracts can be used to create decentralized applications that run on the Solana blockchain, which can be used for a wide range of use cases, including decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and social networking.

Solana's development team has been continuously improving the platform since its launch, releasing regular updates and introducing new features. As of 2023, Solana is one of the fastest-growing blockchain platforms in the market, with a rapidly expanding ecosystem of dApps, exchanges, and other blockchain projects.

These features, especially high TPS rates, low transaction fees, support for special tokens, and smart contracts make the **Solana** chain the best choice for **Get On Vibe**. There is wide spread Dex support, a lot of active development which shows that Solana is here to stay.

## The problem

### Privacy
Social media platforms are designed to keep users engaged and active on their sites. However, this design comes at a cost to individual privacy, as social media companies collect vast amounts of data on users, including personal information, location data, and browsing history. This data allows companies to create detailed user profiles, which can then be monetized through targeted advertising. A 2020 study by the Norwegian Consumer Council<sup>[1]</sup> found that social media companies "systematically" violate users' privacy rights, including sharing data with third-party companies without consent. Additionally, social media algorithms can reinforce filter bubbles and contribute to the spread of misinformation. A 2018 study by Pew Research Center<sup>[2]</sup> found that 64% of adults in the United States believe social media has a mostly negative effect on the way news is reported. It is important for users to be aware of these risks and take measures to protect their privacy online.


In addition to the privacy concerns mentioned previously, social media companies have the power to influence the content users see on their platforms. By controlling algorithms and promoting certain content over others, social media companies can shape public opinion and perpetuate certain ideas or narratives. A study by The Markup<sup>[3]</sup> in 2020 found that Facebook's ad delivery system enables advertisers to exclude certain groups from seeing their ads, based on factors such as age, gender, race, and zip code. This type of targeting can result in discriminatory practices and limit the reach of certain content.

### Monetization

One of the major challenges facing creators on social media platforms is the difficulty of monetizing their content. While the rise of platforms like YouTube and TikTok has made it easier for creators to reach large audiences, many of these platforms offer limited options for monetization. In particular, many social networks rely heavily on advertising revenue, meaning that only creators with large and engaged followings are able to generate significant income.

One way in which content monetization favors large players is through the use of so-called "creator funds." Several platforms, including TikTok and YouTube, have established funds that allow creators to earn money based on the views and engagement their content receives. However, these funds tend to be structured in a way that heavily favors large and well-established creators. For example, on TikTok<sup>[4]</sup>, the company's Creator Fund pays out based on a formula that takes into account a creator's engagement levels, meaning that those with larger followings are more likely to benefit. Similarly, on YouTube<sup>[5]</sup>, creators must meet certain eligibility requirements before they can earn money through the platform's Partner Program, including minimum thresholds for subscribers and watch time.

Another way in which content monetization favors large players is through the use of brand deals and sponsorships. Creators with large and engaged followings are often able to command high fees for sponsored posts and product placements, while smaller creators may struggle to generate any income through these channels. This places a disproportionate burden on smaller creators to generate income through alternative means, such as merchandise sales or Patreon subscriptions.

## Risks
The Get On Vibe Network is currently in the initial development stages, and there are a variety of unforeseeable risks. You acknowledge and agree that numerous risks are associated with acquiring GOYB, holding GOYB, and using GOYB as part of transactions within the Get On Vibe Network. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of GOYB held.

IF YOU DECIDE TO ACQUIRE GOYB OR CONTRIBUTE TO THE GET ON VIBE Network, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE FOLLOWING RISKS:

1/. **Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions** The regulatory status of the Get On Vibe Network, GOYB, and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. The regulation of digital assets has become a primary target of regulations in all major countries in the world. It is impossible to predict how, when, or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulations or create new regulations with respect to such technology and its applications, including GOYB or the Get On Vibe Network. Regulatory actions could negatively impact GOYB or the Get On Vibe Network in various ways. The Company, the Distributor (or their respective affiliates) may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.

2/. **Inadequate disclosure of information** As of the date hereof, Get On Vibe Network is still under development. Its design concepts, consensus mechanisms, algorithms, codes, and other technical details and parameters may be constantly and frequently updated and changed. Although this white/lite paper contains the most current information relating to the Get On Vibe Network, it is not absolutely complete. It may still be adjusted and updated by the Get on Vibe team from time to time. The Get On Vibe Network team has no ability or obligation to keep GOYB holders informed of every detail (including development progress and expected milestones) regarding the project to develop the Get On Vibe Network. Hence insufficient information disclosure is inevitable and reasonable.

3/. **Failure to develop** There is the risk that the development of the Get On Vibe Network will not be executed or implemented as planned. It may be for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency, or GOYB, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.

4/. **Security weaknesses** Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with GOYB or the Get On Vibe Network in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company, the Distributor, or their respective affiliates may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of GOYB or the Get On Vibe Network, which could negatively affect GOYB or the Get on Vibe Network. The future of cryptography and security innovations are highly unpredictable, and advances in cryptography, or technical advances (including without limitation development of quantum computing), could present unknown risks to GOYB or the Get On Vibe Network by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins that blockchain protocol.

5/. **Other risks** The potential risks briefly mentioned above are not exhaustive. There are other risks (as more particularly set out in the Terms and Conditions) associated with your participation in the Get On Vibe Network, as well as the acquisition of, holding, and use of GOYB, including those that the Company or the Distributor cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the aforementioned risks. You should conduct full due diligence on the Company, the Distributor, their respective affiliates, and the Get On Vibe Network team, as well as understand the overall framework, mission.
